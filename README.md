# Buff It 2 The Limit

A fork of [factubsio's BubbleBuffs](https://github.com/factubsio/BubbleBuffs) — the buff automation mod for **Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous**, now continued as **Buff It 2 The Limit**.

## Highlights

- **All buff sources in one place** — Spells, scrolls, potions, wands, and activatable equipment (staves, rods) live in a unified Buffs tab with one entry per buff regardless of source. Inline source-type controls + priority ordering. Wands use UMD logic like scrolls.
- **Toggles, songs and activatables** — Bardic Performance, Inspire Courage, Hunter's Bond and other free-toggle / song / activatable abilities are first-class buff sources. Round-limit auto-deactivation, mutual exclusivity within the same activation group, and proper handling of form-change abilities (Shifter's Fury, Chimeric Aspect).
- **Cast on Combat Start** — Mark buffs to fire automatically when combat begins, or flip the global "Cast all buffs on combat start" switch in the settings panel to fire every configured buff without marking each one. Optional Skip-Animations mode casts instantly so you don't lose the surprise round to animation time.
- **Reserve companion support** — Configure buffs for characters who aren't in your active party. When they swap in, their buff configuration travels with them.
- **Smart casting** — Extend Rod metamagic auto-pick, Bypass Arcane Spell Failure when prebuffing out of combat, Brownfur Transmuter (Share Transmutation), Azata Zippy Magic, Powerful Change, Magic Deceiver fused spells, Magic Weapon (EnhanceWeapon), and crafted-item caster levels all handled correctly.
- **Multi-group assignment** — One buff can belong to Normal, Quick, and Important groups simultaneously.
- **Customizable keyboard shortcuts** — Bind each buff group and the buff menu to a keyboard shortcut with modifier-key support.
- **Quick open button** — HUD button jumps straight into buff configuration without navigating the spellbook.
- **Redesigned details panel** — Vertical split layout with spell info, source controls, scrollable caster/target portraits with reserve separator, and an action bar.
- **Source-type overlays** — Game-native icons on caster portraits showing spell, scroll, potion or equipment source.
- **Sort-by-name toggle** — Optional alphabetical buff ordering, persisted across save reloads and area transitions.
- **Improved buff filtering** — Better detection of beneficial vs harmful spells via descriptor checks, nested action analysis, and equipment-item recognition.

## About

Buff It 2 The Limit adds an in-game option to spellbooks to create buff routines. Configure which buffs to cast on which party members, then execute entire buff sequences with a single click.

## Known mod interactions

- **BubbleTweak animation speedup + animated casting**: When BubbleTweak's "Increase Animation Speed" is active and Buff It 2 The Limit is set to use full cast animations, some casts can be dropped silently. The sped-up animation can finish the underlying `UnitCommand` before the spell rule actually fires, so the buff never lands even though the cast was queued. Workaround: enable **Skip animations** in this mod, or disable BubbleTweak's animation-speed multiplier for casting. The combat-log "applied" count reports actually-fired casts so you can spot the mismatch.

## Development Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Provide game DLLs — either:
   - Set `WrathInstallDir` environment variable to your game install path, or
   - Create `GamePath.props` in the repo root (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for format)
3. Build:
   ```bash
   dotnet build BuffIt2TheLimit/BuffIt2TheLimit.csproj
   ```
4. Output goes to `BuffIt2TheLimit/bin/Debug/` — copy contents to `{GameDir}/Mods/BuffIt2TheLimit/`
